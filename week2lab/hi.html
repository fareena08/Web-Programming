      Hi, my name is Fareena binti Mohammad Firdaus, a 2nd year Software Engineering student at UKM. This is my page for my web programming course. First of all, let me talk a bit about myself.<p>
	
	I started my bachelor's degree online, but it is not an excuse to not being a productive student. I took an initiative to join Mobile Application Development (MAD) club in my faculty to expand my knowledge in this field and gain more skills. I had also participated various competition mostly related to mobile app development to explore more interesting experience. It is surely more challenging studying online rather than face-to-face class because a constant motivation is highly needed but I am grateful that all my friends and lecturers are so helpful and understanding. Therefore, that is the reason that I can adapt well for this 2 years and not giving up.
